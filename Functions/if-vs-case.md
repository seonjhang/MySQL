# 🔄 When to Use `IF()` vs `CASE` in MySQL

Both `IF()` and `CASE` in MySQL allow conditional logic, but they are designed for different use cases. Here's a guide to when they are interchangeable and when one is required over the other.

---

## ✅ Interchangeable Use Cases

In **simple binary conditions**, `IF()` and `CASE` can be used interchangeably.

### Example 1: Labeling Salary Level

```sql
-- Using IF()
SELECT name,
       IF(salary > 5000, 'High', 'Low') AS salary_label
FROM Employees;

-- Using CASE
SELECT name,
       CASE 
           WHEN salary > 5000 THEN 'High'
           ELSE 'Low'
       END AS salary_label
FROM Employees;
```

📌 Both will return the same result here. Either is fine.

## 🚫 NOT Interchangeable

### 1. Multiple Conditions → Use `CASE`

```sql
-- ✅ CASE supports multiple branches
SELECT name,
       CASE
           WHEN salary > 8000 THEN 'High'
           WHEN salary > 5000 THEN 'Medium'
           ELSE 'Low'
       END AS salary_band
FROM Employees;

-- ❌ IF() does not support multiple branches cleanly
-- You would need nested IFs, which quickly becomes unreadable.
```

### 2. Standard SQL Compatibility → Use `CASE`

If you want your SQL to run across multiple databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQL Server), `CASE` is the preferred choice. `IF()` is **MySQL-specific** and not part of standard SQL.

| Feature/Scenario             | `IF()`                  | `CASE`                        |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Binary logic                | ✅ Simple and concise     | ✅ Also works                  |
| Multiple conditions         | ❌ Hard to manage         | ✅ Clean and flexible          |
| SQL standard compliance     | ❌ MySQL-only             | ✅ Portable across databases   |
| Readability (complex logic) | ❌ Low                    | ✅ High                        |
| Use in `SELECT` clause      | ✅                        | ✅                             |
| Use in `ORDER BY`, `WHERE`  | ✅                        | ✅                             |

## 💡 Recommendation

- Use `IF()` for **quick, simple true/false logic**.
- Use `CASE` for **everything else**, especially multiple conditions or portable code.
