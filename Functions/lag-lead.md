# üîÅ LAG() and LEAD() in MySQL

`LAG()` and `LEAD()` are **window functions** that allow access to other rows in a result set **without using JOINs or subqueries**. They are commonly used to compare a row with its previous or next row.

---

## üìå General Concept

### üîÅ `LAG(expression [, offset, default])`

- Returns a value from a **previous row** in the window frame.
- Optional parameters:
  - `offset`: how many rows back to look (default = 1)
  - `default`: value to return if there‚Äôs no row

```sql
LAG(temperature, 1, NULL) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate)
```

---

### ‚è© `LEAD(expression [, offset, default])`

- Returns a value from a **next row**.
- Same optional parameters as `LAG()`.

```sql
LEAD(temperature, 1, NULL) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate)
```

### üß† Use Cases

| Scenario                              | Use Function |
|---------------------------------------|--------------|
| Compare with previous day's value     | `LAG()`      |
| Detect upward/downward trends         | `LAG()` or `LEAD()` |
| Compare with next week's data         | `LEAD()` with offset = 7 |
| Avoid complex `JOIN` or `SELF-JOIN`   | Both         |

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Requires **MySQL 8.0 or higher**.
- Part of the **ANSI SQL:2003** standard.
- Cannot be used directly in `WHERE` clause‚Äîuse in `SELECT`, subquery, or `HAVING`.

---

Window functions `LAG()` and `LEAD()` are used to access data from a previous or next row **without using self joins**.

## üîÅ LAG()

- Retrieves the value from a previous row.
- Commonly used to compare a current value with the one before it.

```sql
SELECT id, temperature,
       LAG(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prev_temp
FROM Weather;
```

---

## ‚è© LEAD()

- Retrieves the value from the next row.
- Useful for comparing current value with the next value.

```sql
SELECT id, temperature,
       LEAD(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS next_temp
FROM Weather;
```

---

## üß† Use Case: Compare temperatures

```sql
SELECT id
FROM (
    SELECT id, temperature, recordDate,
           LAG(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prev_temp
    FROM Weather
) AS temp
WHERE temperature > prev_temp;
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Available in MySQL 8.0 and above.
- Cannot be used in earlier versions‚Äîuse JOINs as an alternative.

---

## ‚ùì FAQ: Can I use `LAG()` without `OVER()`?

**No, you cannot.**

The `LAG()` function is a window function and **must always be used with an `OVER()` clause**. Without it, SQL has no way to determine the "previous row".

### üîç Examples

```sql
-- ‚ùå Invalid: This will raise a syntax error
SELECT LAG(temperature) FROM Weather;

-- ‚úÖ Valid: Defines window and row order
SELECT LAG(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) FROM Weather;
```

### üß† Why is `OVER()` required?

- It defines the **window frame** of rows
- It establishes how to order those rows to know which one comes ‚Äúbefore‚Äù or ‚Äúafter‚Äù

You may see some window functions like `COUNT(*) OVER ()` without `ORDER BY`, but for `LAG()` and `LEAD()` this is **not optional**.
