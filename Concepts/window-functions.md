# ðŸªŸ Window Functions in MySQL

Window functions allow you to perform calculations **across a set of rows that are related to the current row**, while still preserving individual rows in the result.

---

## ðŸ“˜ What Is a Window Function?

Unlike aggregate functions (`SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc.) that collapse multiple rows into one, **window functions return a value for each row**.

**Syntax:**
```sql
<function>() OVER (
    PARTITION BY column
    ORDER BY column
    [ROWS BETWEEN ...]
)
```

## ðŸ”‘ Key Clauses

- `PARTITION BY`: Divides result set into partitions (like groups)
- `ORDER BY`: Orders rows within each partition
- `ROWS BETWEEN`: Defines the window frame (optional)

## ðŸ§± Common Window Functions in MySQL

| Category       | Function          | Description                                      |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Ranking        | `ROW_NUMBER()`     | Assigns unique row numbers                       |
|                | `RANK()`           | Rank with gaps                                   |
|                | `DENSE_RANK()`     | Rank without gaps                                |
| Aggregates     | `SUM()`, `AVG()`   | Running totals, moving averages                  |
| Value Access   | `LAG()`            | Previous row's value                             |
|                | `LEAD()`           | Next row's value                                 |
|                | `FIRST_VALUE()`    | First value in partition                         |
|                | `LAST_VALUE()`     | Last value in partition                          |
| Distribution   | `NTILE(n)`         | Distributes rows into n buckets                  |
|                | `PERCENT_RANK()`   | Percent rank (0 to 1 scale)                      |
|                | `CUME_DIST()`      | Cumulative distribution                          |

## ðŸ§ª Example: `ROW_NUMBER()`

```sql
SELECT name, department, salary,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dept_rank
FROM Employees;
```

- Ranks employees by salary **within each department**
- `PARTITION BY` resets the ranking for each department

---

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- **MySQL 8.0+ only**
- Cannot be used in `WHERE` clause directly â€” use subqueries or `CTE`
- Combine with `JOIN`, `CASE`, and other SQL logic for advanced analytics

---

## ðŸ§  Summary

> Window functions are essential for advanced analytics in SQL. They allow row-by-row operations while maintaining access to the full context of data.

Great for:
- Rankings
- Comparisons
- Running totals
- Trend analysis
