# ðŸ”— SQL JOIN Types

SQL JOINs are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

---

## ðŸ§± Types of JOINs

### 1. INNER JOIN
Returns only the rows with matching values in both tables.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM A
INNER JOIN B ON A.id = B.id;
```

âœ… Use when you only want data where there is a match in both tables.

---

### 2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table. If thereâ€™s no match, the result is NULL on the right side.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM A
LEFT JOIN B ON A.id = B.id;
```

âœ… Use when you want all data from the left table, regardless of match.

---

### 3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table. If thereâ€™s no match, the result is NULL on the left side.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM A
RIGHT JOIN B ON A.id = B.id;
```

âœ… Less common. Use when you want to keep all rows from the right table.

---

### 4. FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)
Returns all rows when there is a match in one of the tables. Non-matching rows will contain NULL for the missing side.

```sql
-- Not supported in MySQL directly, simulate with UNION
SELECT *
FROM A
LEFT JOIN B ON A.id = B.id
UNION
SELECT *
FROM A
RIGHT JOIN B ON A.id = B.id;
```

âœ… Use when you want all data, matched or not.

---

### 5. CROSS JOIN
Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables. Every row from the first table is paired with every row from the second.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM A
CROSS JOIN B;
```

âœ… Use with caution; result set size is (rows in A) Ã— (rows in B).

---

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- Use `INNER JOIN` when match is required.
- Use `LEFT JOIN` to preserve rows from the first table.
- MySQL does not support `FULL OUTER JOIN` nativelyâ€”use `UNION` as shown above.
- Always specify the `ON` condition to avoid unexpected Cartesian products.
